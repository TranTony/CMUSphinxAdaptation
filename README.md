# CMUSphinxAdaptation

The English accent is different all over the world. I would like to make the CMUSphinx run more accurate in my country, I do the adaptation according to the tutorial from the official website.

Here the all steps:
1. Use the MLLR & MAP to adapt the current English model of CMUSphinx.
2. Copy the model to resource/resources/models/en-us-adapt/ in project java
